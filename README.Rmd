# tie

`bow` and `neck` can be combined to `tie` to do something similar to `dplyr::summarise` and `dplyr::mutate` respectively, but allowing to express how to redistribute parts of the results to their own column.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tie)

iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  bow( tie(min, max) := range(Sepal.Length) )

iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  neck( tie(min, max) := range(Sepal.Length) )
```
